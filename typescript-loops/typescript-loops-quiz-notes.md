## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  Loops allow you to execute a code block multiple times within the parameters you set, so it makes them efficient, making it easier to write less code.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  Conditions tell you how when/ where to start/ stop a loop.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  The first time the loop runs is its first iteration and so on. It tells you how many times the loop runs.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  It gets evaluated first so you know where to start the loop, and also every time it runs it checks for this condition when trying to start a new loop.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The initial expression only runs once before the loop begins to iterate.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  It gets evaluated after the initialization expression and will be checked on before every new iteration of the loop to see if it evaluates to true. Once it evaluates to false it stops.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The final expression gets evaluated after each iteration.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  'break'

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  It increments i, so the code will move forward.

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  Using for in loops.
