## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function is a reusable block of code that takes parameters of arguments and runs them through the function. Sometimes functions are anonymous or do not return anything.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  A function can be anonymous but usually it's defined within curly braces, which tells the function what to return.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  When calling a function you name the function (if not anonymous) and then you put the parameters/ arguments in the parantheses and end with a semicolon.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?

A function call tells the function to run with the given arguments, a function defintiion is just telling you what the function does or returns (if there is a return.)

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?

A parameter is used when defining a function, an argument is used when a function is being called.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  They tell you what values to run through the function.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  It tells the function to stop running and tells it what the expected output will be.

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  it needs two parameters, with the => and curly braces.
  ex:
  const add = (num1, num2) => {
  return num1 + num2;
  };

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?

It needs to be put all in one line to run without curly braces.
