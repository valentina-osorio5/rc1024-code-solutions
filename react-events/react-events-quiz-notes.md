- What is an "event" in React?
- An event in react is similar to an event in javascript, but you don't query the dom and add the events directly to the  component or parent component using a prop as opposed to adding an event listener.

- Event handlers are functions that tell you what to do once the event is fired. They normally start with "handle" in named events.  

- How do you pass an event handler to a React component?
- Using event handler props, either directly to the component or to their parent component. 

- What is the naming convention for event handlers?
- "handle" before the named event handler function, which starts with an uppercase letter.

- What is an "event handler prop"? Which component declares the prop?
