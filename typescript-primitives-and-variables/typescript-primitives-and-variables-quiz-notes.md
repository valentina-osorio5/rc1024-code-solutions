## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of variables?
  Variables contain data values.

- How do you **declare** a variable?
  You declare a variable using const, let, var. Const if the variable doesn't change and let if the variable value might change.

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
  You use the "=" to initialize a variable.

- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  Characters can include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but must start with a letter, $, or \_.

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  FirstName, firstName, and firstname are all considered to be different variables because they all have different uppercase/ lower case formats.

- What is the purpose of a string?
  A string is like a set of letters or words put together, enclosed in quotation marks.

- What is the purpose of a number?
  Like in JavaScript, numbers are used to represent both integer and floating-point values. TypeScript has a single number type, and numbers can be written with or without decimals.

- What is the purpose of a boolean?
  A boolean represents either true or false.

- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?
  The '=' is used to assign value to a variable.

- How do you update the value of a variable?
  If a variable is changeable like "let" or "undefined" then you can later update it by adding in a value to an undefined variable or using the '=' assignment operator.

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
  Undefined is used when a variable can later hold a value but is currently only being declared (not assigned a value yet), while null is purposely left as blank or "no value."

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
  Labels can help you understand /add context to the variable you're logging, so you're not just logging random data.

- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.
  string, number, boolean, null, undefined
